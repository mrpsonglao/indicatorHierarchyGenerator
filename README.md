## First prototype for indicator hierarchy generator.
- takes in user input to determine what to generate (TCdata360 vs Govdata360)
- generates 3 CSVs: nav dataset, hierarchy dataset, and merged nav and hierarchy based in indicator name
- includes sample outputs (CSVs) for TCdata360 and Govdata360 generated as of July 4, 2017

## For improvement:
- documentation
